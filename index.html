	<p>Living a simple life is about paring back, so that you have space to breathe. It’s about doing with less, because you realize that having more and doing more doesn’t lead to happiness. It’s about finding joys in the simple things, and being content with solitude, quiet, contemplation and savoring the moment.

I’ve learned some key lessons for living a simple life, and I thought I’d share a few with you.

We create our own struggles. All the stress, all the frustrations and disappointments, all the busyness and rushing … we create these with attachments in our heads. By letting go, we can relax and live more simply.
Become mindful of attachments that lead to clutter and complexity. For example, if you are attached to sentimental items, you won’t be able to let go of clutter. If you are attached to living a certain way, you will not be able to let go of a lot of stuff. If you are attached to doing a lot of activities and messaging everyone, your life will be complex.</p>
<p>Single-task by putting your life in full-screen mode. Imagine that everything you do — a work task, answering an email or message, washing a dish, reading an article — goes into full-screen mode, so that you don’t do or look at anything else. You just inhabit that task fully, and are fully present as you do it. What would your life be like? In my experience, it’s much less stressful when you work and live this way. Things get your full attention, and you do them much better. And you can even savor them.
Create space between things. Add padding to everything. Do half of what you imagine you can do. We tend to cram as much as possible into our days. And this becomes stressful, because we always underestimate how long things will take, and we forget about maintenance tasks like putting on clothes and brushing teeth and preparing meals. We never feel like we have enough time because we try to do too much. But what would it be like if we did less? What would it be like if we padded how long things took, so that we have the space to actually do them well, with full attention? What would it be like if we took a few minutes’ pause between tasks, to savor the accomplishment of the last task, to savor the space between things, to savor being alive?</p>

<p>Life is hard – let’s face it. Life is full of unexpected curve balls, setbacks, tragedies and challenges. For many, life can seem like a never ending and constant uphill battle. I can relate to this sentiment because my own life has never been easy.

However, when we have faced many challenges, perhaps one after another, or when life seems the hardest – we must never give up, on ourselves or in life.

Never give up the battle to overcome each new challenge that comes your way – challenges build inner strength and character. We learn more about ourselves through each new challenge, and we build strength with each new challenge. Try to view them this way.

And never give up the battle to succeed in your life or to achieve your goals and dreams – no matter how many setbacks you face, and no matter how hard or far away they may seem.

Take baby steps if that helps. Sometimes baby steps help goals and dreams to seem more achievable and realistic. It may be a matter of one step forward, and two steps back – but at least you are taking a step forward.

Keep taking steps. Your goals are within reach and are achievable with consistent effort and with faith and belief in yourself.</p>
<p>Maintaining faith in oneself is critical for achieving goals and dreams, so never give up on yourself, first and foremost. Have faith in yourself that you CAN DO THIS – never say you cannot.

And never give up on having hope, even if it is the smallest sliver of hope that you must hold onto – hold on. Sometimes, it may take a leap of faith that good things will happen. Sometimes, we just have to believe and have faith that we will be OK in the end, no matter what is happening in our lives.

I am not suggesting here that we sit back passively in life, holding onto hope and faith that things will fall in place or that life will get better. We must be proactive in life, too, and make things happen in order for our lives to improve.

Never giving up means being proactive. We need to proactively tackle challenges; we must proactively solve problems; and we must proactively pursue our goals and dreams.</p>
